# Detailed VS Code Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Adobe Experience Platform Event Forwarder Lambda function using VS Code's AWS Toolkit extension.

## Prerequisites

1. VS Code installed
2. AWS Toolkit extension installed
3. AWS credentials configured either as a profile or environment variables
4. AEP credentials saved in AWS Secrets Manager
5. Docker installed and running (for local testing)

## Local Testing

### Step 1: Configure AWS Credentials in VS Code

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the Command Palette
2. Type "AWS: Connect to AWS" and select it
3. Choose your AWS profile from the list

### Step 2: Test Locally

1. Open the Command Palette again
2. Type "AWS: Run SAM Application Locally" and select it
3. Select "API" option to start a local API Gateway
4. If prompted for the template file, select your `template.yaml`
5. Wait for Docker to initialize and the API to start (may take a minute)

### Step 3: Test with Postman

1. Open Postman or your preferred API testing tool
2. Create a new POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/connect-event`
3. Set the Content-Type header to `application/json`
4. Add a test JSON payload in the request body:
   ```json
   {
     "order_id": "XU7L020O9M59VQ4S98",
     "order_time": "2023-08-05T06:23:23Z",
     "order_total": "69.69",
     "customer_id": "64a85c39fc13ae36aebeed8c",
     "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
     "customer_name": "John Doe"
   }
   ```
5. Send the request and verify you receive a successful response

## Deployment to AWS

### Step 1: Deploy with AWS Toolkit

1. Open the VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "AWS: Deploy SAM Application" and select it
3. If prompted for the template file, select your `template.yaml`
4. Choose an S3 bucket for deployment, or create a new one
5. Enter a stack name (e.g., "aep-event-forwarder")
6. Select an AWS region 
7. Review the deployment parameters and confirm

### Step 2: Monitor Deployment

1. VS Code will show deployment progress in the OUTPUT panel
2. Wait for the "âœ… Successfully deployed" message
3. The API Gateway endpoint URL will be displayed in the output

### Step 3: Test the Deployed Endpoint

1. Copy the API Gateway endpoint URL from the deployment output
2. Open Postman and create a POST request to this URL
3. Set the Content-Type header to `application/json`
4. Add a test JSON payload similar to the one used for local testing
5. Send the request and verify the Lambda is working in production

### Step 4: View Logs (Optional)

1. In VS Code, expand the AWS Explorer panel
2. Navigate to Lambda > Your Function Name
3. Right-click on the function and select "View Logs"
4. Choose a log stream to view execution logs

## Updating the Function

When you make changes to your function code:

1. Test locally using the steps above
2. Deploy again using "AWS: Deploy SAM Application"
3. Select the same stack name to update the existing deployment
4. Confirm the update

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Deployment Fails**: Check your IAM permissions and that you have sufficient permissions to create CloudFormation stacks
- **Secret Access Issues**: Verify the Secrets Manager secret names match what's in your template
- **Testing Fails Locally**: Make sure Docker is running and that your AWS credentials have permission to access Secrets Manager
- **VS Code Not Showing AWS Resources**: Refresh your AWS Explorer panel or reconnect to AWS

### Viewing CloudFormation Errors

If deployment fails:

1. Open the AWS Explorer panel in VS Code
2. Navigate to AWS CloudFormation > Stacks
3. Right-click on your stack and select "View Stack Events"
4. Look for errors in the events list
